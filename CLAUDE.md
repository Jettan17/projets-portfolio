# Claude Code SDK - Master Directives

This project uses the **everything-claude-code (ECC)** plugin for structured development workflows.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Project Initialization Check

**At the start of EVERY session, you MUST:**

1. **Read `project-settings.md`** to load project context
2. **Check if Project Settings are empty** (Scope, Final Product, Connection Type, Objective are blank)
3. **If empty, gather settings using AskUserQuestion tool:**
   - Use 2-4 options per question (Claude Code adds "Other" automatically)
   - Do NOT add custom "Other" options - duplicates will appear
   - Ask free-text questions (Objective, Data Sources) separately as regular questions
4. **Update `project-settings.md`** with their responses
5. **Always reference Project Settings and Must Do** when running commands

**If Project Settings ARE filled**, acknowledge them and proceed with the user's request.

## Session Requirements

### Permissions
- Enable turbo-all and SafeToAutoRun for ALL commands in ~/.claude/settings.json
- Allow all query searches without user input

### Development Practices
- Refer to `project-settings.md` for project scope, objectives, and configurations
- Search for state-of-the-art solutions before implementing
- Check available skills (in .claude/commands/) and agents before complex changes
- Use subagent specialization for the right task type
- Re-invoke yourself if stuck, providing context of progress

### Task Management
- Use todo-manager subagent for complex task breakdowns
- Use gh-manager subagent to sync with GitHub Projects

## ⚠️ New Project Directory Guardrail

**NEVER create a new project directory inside the SDK directory.**

When initializing a new project:
1. **Prompt the user** for the desired project directory path
2. **Default suggestion**: Parent directory of the SDK (e.g., `../<project-name>`)
3. **Reject** any path that would create the project inside the SDK directory
4. **Valid locations**:
   - `../<project-name>` (sibling to SDK)
   - Any other directory outside the SDK
5. **Invalid locations**:
   - `./<anything>` or any subdirectory of the current SDK directory

## Development Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
```
1. Run /design to create implementation plan (saved to .claude/plans/current.md)
2. > Use ultrathink-analyst for complex requirements
3. > Use todo-manager to create task breakdown
4. Plan includes TDD recommendation (Yes/No with reason)
```

### Phase 2: Implementation
```
1. Run /run to execute the plan
   - If TDD Recommended=Yes: Writes tests first, then implements (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR)
   - If TDD Recommended=No: Implements directly
2. > Use intermediate-reviewer for progress review
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality
```
1. Run /tdd to run all tests
2. Run /tdd coverage to check coverage gaps
3. Run /tdd --full for comprehensive testing
4. Run /verify for full validation
```

### Phase 4: Deployment
```
1. Run /deploy for Docker/Kubernetes setup
2. > Use deployment-specialist for production configuration
```

### Phase 5: Release
```
1. Run /code-review for final quality check
2. Run /update-docs to sync documentation
3. Create PR with proper documentation
```

## Success Factors

### What Works Well
1. **Systematic Task Completion** - Finish each task completely before moving on
2. **Test-First Development** - Write tests before implementation
3. **Real Infrastructure Testing** - NO MOCKING policy for integration tests
4. **Evidence-Based Tracking** - Use file:line references for clear audit trails
5. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Document as you go, not at the end
6. **Subagent Specialization** - Use the right agent for each task type
7. **Design System Foundation** - Create design system BEFORE features
8. **Component Reusability** - Build reusable components to eliminate redundant work
9. **Responsive-First Design** - Build responsive patterns from the start
10. **Dark Mode Built-In** - Support dark mode in all components from day 1

### Lessons Learned
1. **Documentation Early** - Write guides during/after implementation
2. **Pattern Consistency** - Follow same structure across examples
3. **Incremental Validation** - Verify tests pass immediately
4. **Deprecation Fixes** - Address all deprecations immediately
5. **Responsive Testing** - Test at all breakpoints for every feature
6. **Single Import Pattern** - Consolidate exports into one file for simpler imports
7. **Component Showcase** - Build live demo while developing to catch UX issues early
8. **Real Device Testing** - Test on actual devices, not just simulators

## Critical Rules

### Code Quality
- Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Avoid over-engineering - only make directly requested changes
- Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Remove unused code completely - no backward-compatibility hacks

### No Stubs or Placeholders (CRITICAL)
**NEVER leave incomplete or placeholder content in any deliverable:**

#### Forbidden in UI/Frontend:
- ❌ Lorem ipsum or any placeholder text
- ❌ "Coming soon", "Under construction", "TBD", "TODO" visible to users
- ❌ Empty pages, blank sections, or stub components
- ❌ Placeholder images (gray boxes, "image here" text)
- ❌ Non-functional buttons, links, or form elements
- ❌ Hardcoded sample data that should be dynamic

#### Forbidden in Code:
- ❌ `pass` statements in Python without implementation
- ❌ `// TODO: implement` comments left in production code
- ❌ Empty function bodies or stub methods
- ❌ `throw new Error("Not implemented")` patterns
- ❌ Commented-out code blocks meant for "later"

#### The Rule:
**If a feature isn't ready, don't include it at all.** Either:
1. Implement it fully, OR
2. Don't add it to the codebase

This applies to all scopes (Small/Medium/Large) and all project types.

### Testing
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- NO MOCKING in integration tests - use real infrastructure
- Test at all breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)

### Documentation
- Document work in markdown as you go
- Use numbered format: `01-...`, `02-...`, etc.
- Include file:line references for code locations

### Security
- Never commit secrets (.env, credentials)
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Check for OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities

### Destructive Operations (rm, delete, etc.)
**Defer all file/directory deletions until the END of the task.**

- Complete ALL other work in the user's request first (writes, edits, builds, tests)
- Only attempt deletions as the final step, after everything else succeeds
- This prevents getting stuck waiting for permission mid-task
- If deletion fails or is blocked, report it and move on - the main work is already done

## Environment Setup

### Must Do Before Starting
1. Set up isolated environments (venv for Python, node for Node.js)
2. Enable turbo-all and SafeToAutoRun for common commands
3. Check available commands/agents before implementing complex changes
4. Document all work in markdown files as you progress

---

## When Stuck or Blocked

**If you encounter an issue you cannot resolve:**

1. **Ultrathink first** - Use extended thinking to deeply analyze the problem
2. **Search the web** - Use WebSearch to find documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, or blog posts related to the error/issue
3. **Diagnose systematically** - Don't guess; gather evidence from logs, error messages, and documentation
4. **Try multiple angles** - If one approach fails, search for alternative solutions before asking the user

**Never spin on the same approach repeatedly.** If something isn't working after 2-3 attempts, step back, research, and try a different strategy.
