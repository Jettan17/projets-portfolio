## About This Project

This portfolio website showcases my work as a web developer. Built with Astro for optimal performance, it features a vibrant, High-Key design aesthetic with bold colors and creative layouts.

## Key Features

- **Fast Performance**: Static site generation with Astro for lightning-fast load times
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that looks great on all devices
- **Modern CSS**: Custom properties and CSS Grid for flexible, maintainable styles
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management with Astro's Content Collections
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant with proper semantic HTML and focus management

## Technical Highlights

The site uses vanilla CSS with a comprehensive design token system, avoiding external CSS frameworks while maintaining a consistent visual language throughout.

Animation and interactivity are kept minimal and purposeful, enhancing the user experience without compromising performance.
